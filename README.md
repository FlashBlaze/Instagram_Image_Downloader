# Instagram_Image_Downloader

The [insta.py](https://github.com/FlashBlaze/Instagram_Image_Downloader/blob/master/insta.py) is originally by [Sunil02324](https://github.com/Sunil02324/Instagram-Image-Downloader). I made some changes to make it compatible with Python 3.x

This script downloads images and saves files as fileName.jpg 
To change the file name, I wrote [filechange.py](https://github.com/FlashBlaze/Instagram_Image_Downloader/blob/master/filechange.py) to change the file name to current date and time to make it unique.

## Usage

Run
`python insta.py` to get to know CLI and then after donwloading the image, 

Run
`python filechange.py` to change the file name.

## Requirements

[Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
